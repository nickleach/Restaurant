          It all started back in 1969 with the idea of "food should be fun" by our founder, Bern Flasko. 
          <br>
          Born in the small town of Paris, Texas he acquired the taste of fine dining at a young age. His dad was a renowned circus performer, often performing along with the father of Marc Cuban, "the amazing cube" in the Voudville circus. His mother was a street performer, specializing as a contortionist. Bern Flasko was horribly embarrassed by his destitute upbringing and rejected his parents. At the age of 6 he bought himself his first suit, and started working as a host in the local Ritz Carlton restaurant. 
          <br>
          It was there that he learned the importance of fine dining, both for the pysche and for the soul. Whether it was a creme brulee topped with creme fraiche or a hot dog topped with creme fraiche. He learned the importance of creme friache, and has incorporated it with every single dish he has ever created, making it his signature. 
        </p>

          After many years of working as a chef, he finally opened up his own restaurant called "Go Fraiche Yourself" where the Iron Chef, Gordon Ramsay, studied under him as his apprentice. After the great success of his first venture, he decided to expand creating a multi-national conglomerate named "Madrigal", which had a variety of restaurants ranging from sushi with Creme Fraiche to Los Pollos Hermanos, with Creme Fraiche.
          <br>
          FÃ¼d was created by Bern in an effort to show the president that Creme Fraiche is a force to be reckoned with. He was originally approached by the Reagan Administration to start research on Creme Fraiche, but he had to decline because the administration did not access to powerful enough equipment to contain the taste that the Fraiche brought. He awaited 25 years for the presidancy to gain access to such equipment, and will be serving as a personal chef to the White House and all who are the non-believers of the Fraiche.
